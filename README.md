Development Log:
1/3/2019
- Worked on Fraction class, mostly done with all the methods in there; also added extra methods needed. (Peihua)
- Worked on the foundation for the Graph class: a graph with axis can be made with specified or non specified bounds. (Jawwad)

1/4/2019
- Finished the Fraction class and started working on Monomial. (Peihua)
- Added work on Monomial class (Jawwad) and merged. 
       -Our first merge conflict! *sheds a tear*
       -Complication#1: Adding/Subtracting a monomial to another monomial without the same base and exponent causes the creation of a polynomial, but polynomial has not yet been defined (created). So for now, we won't touch it but we need to figure this out.
